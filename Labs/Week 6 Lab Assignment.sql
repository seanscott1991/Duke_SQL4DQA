-- 1. Using the draft table in Basketball_women, return the school that had the most players drafted into the WNBA league  --
-- for each year.  If there is a tie, return the school that had the lowest average 'draftOverall' value for --
-- that year.  Output should include only 2 columns, year and school. --







-- 2. Use the Credit database. I have a theory that months that saw growth in average charge amount from the previous month have a higher --
-- percentage of category 7 charges than months that saw decline.  Please return percentage of category 7 charges for months that saw -- 
-- growth in average charge amount as well as those that saw decline --






-- 3. Use the Credit database.  The credit card company likes to mail special offers to members who were in the first $1,000,000 of the company's charges --
-- each month.  Return the count of how many offers must be mailed to each region each month.  A member should be only sent 1 offer per month.  Please --
-- order results by month and then by offers sent descending --

-- period and the third value should be the total order price of the period. --
